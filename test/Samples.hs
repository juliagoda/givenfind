module Samples where


--- Questions samples ---

questionSample1 = "This example is based on the method described in the previous article, where we test only GUI. So the code will not contain an instance of a window from a local file. Does this make any sense? Maybe doesn't?"
      
questionSample2 = "First things first, what is property-based testing?"

questionSample3 = "Here, the argument of f will be pattern-matched against pattern1."

questionSample4 = "What does the following program print out? And why?"

questionSample5 = "?"

questionSample6 = "\\?\\?"

questionSample7 = "The question mark ? is a punctuation mark that indicates an interrogative clause or phrase in many languages."

questionSample8 = "The question mark '?' is a punctuation mark that indicates an interrogative clause or phrase in many languages."

questionSample9 = "    ?    " 


--- Tasks samples ---

taskSample1 = "A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly over a time of 5.21 seconds for a distance of 110 m. Determine the acceleration of the car. Find acceleration, if time is 10 seconds for a distance of 200 m. What will be the result?" 

taskSample2 = "You can purchase any of the items on the menu, but you cannot buy more than one of the same item, and you cannot spend more than $10.00. Find out how many different lunches you could buy without receiving any change back. What will be the result?"

taskSample3 = "   .    "

taskSample4 = "Find?"

taskSample5 = "Find"

taskSample6 = "Find."

taskSample7 = "Using the menu to the left, find out how many different lunches you could buy without receiving any change back."


--- Physics tasks samples ---

taskPhysicsSample1 = "A light ray strikes a reflective plane surface at an angle of 56° with the surface. Find the angle made by the reflected ray and the surface."

taskPhysicsSample2 = "Let a ray of light being incident through a medium of refractive index n1 = 1.1 onto a medium of refractive index n2 = 1.0. Let i be the angle of incidence and t being the angle of refraction."

taskPhysicsSample3 = "Optical fiber systems are used in communication systems to transmit information using light as a carrier. Since light as an electromagnetic wave has frequencies of the order 1014 Hertz, very high rate of data may be transferred using optical fiber systems."

taskPhysicsSample4 = "A man fires a rock out of a slingshot directly upward. The rock has an initial velocity of 15 m/s. How long will it take for the rock to return to the level he fired it at?"

taskPhysicsSample5 = "It takes a man 10 seconds to ride down an escalator. It takes the same man 15 s to walk back up the escalator against its motion. How long will it take the man to walk down the escalator at the same rate he was walking before?"

taskPhysicsSample6 = "A man riding a bicycle at a speed of 25 km/h passes a parked car. When the bicycle is 100 m ahead of the car, the car starts. The car instantly accelerates to a speed of 50 km/h, and subsequently maintains that speed. Find out when and where the car passes the bicycle, using both a graphical method and an arithmetical method."
      
taskPhysicsSample7 = "Cinderella leaves the ball at quarter to twelve in a coach travelling at a speed of 12 mph. Five minutes later the prince also leaves the ball following her. Calculate the speed at which the prince reaches her just as the clock strikes twelve."

taskPhysicsSample8 = "Two sporty snails are having a race. Because one of them is a famous sprinter, the other is given a head start of 1.0 meters. 15 minutes after the start of the race the sprinter catches up with the slower one. The sprinter was creeping at a speed of 60 cm/min. Calculate the speed of the slower snail."

taskPhysicsSample9 = "Consider an oil film on water. If you see green light (532 nm) reflecting back when sunlight is normally incident, what is the minimum thickness of the film?"

taskPhysicsSample10 = "An air bubble at the bottom of a lake 50.0 m deep has a volume of 10 mL. If the temperature at the bottom is 4°C and at the top 27°C, what is the volume of the bubble just before it reaches the surface?"

taskPhysicsSample11 = "Heat is the process of energy transfer from one body or system due to thermal contact, which in turn is defined as an energy transfer to a body in any other way than due to work performed on the body."
